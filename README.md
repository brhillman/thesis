# thesis
Source for my masters thesis at University of Washington, published in 2012

This repository contains the source for both the document itself, and for the code to recreate the analysis and figures from the document. However, the model output and observations used in the study are not included here. Those will need to be obtained separately to recreate the analysis.

TODO: add instructions for obtaining the observations and model simulations used in the thesis.

TODO: add source modifications to CAM3 and AM2 to include COSP, as needed to perform the simulations used in the thesis. Also possibly add scripts to recreate these simulations.
